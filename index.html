    <h2>Early life</h2>

    <p>Richard Tiffany Gere was born in <a href="#">Philadelphia</a> on August 31, 1949,<sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup>#
        the eldest
        son and second
        Doris Ann (née Tiffany; 1924–2016) and <a href="#">NMIC</a> insurance agent Homer George Gere
        (1922-2023).<sup><a href="#">[5][6]</a></sup>
        His father
        originally intended to become a <a href="#">minister</a>.<sup><a href="#">[7]</a></sup> Gere was raised <sup><a
                href="#">[8][9]</a></sup><a href="#">Methodist</a> in
        <a href="#">Syracuse</a>, <sup></sup><a href="#">New York.[10]</a><sup></sup> His
        paternal great-grandfather, George Lane Gere (1848–1932), changed the spelling of his surname from "Geer". One
        of his ancestors, also named George, was an Englishman who came from Heavitree and settled in the Connecticut
        Colony in 1638.<sup><a href="#">[11]</a></sup> Both of Gere's parents were <a href="#">Mayflower</a>
        descendants; his
        ancestors include
        Pilgrims such as
        <a href="#">John Billington</a>, <a href="#">William Brewster</a>, <a href="#">Francis Eaton</a>, <a
            href="#">Francis Cooke</a>, <a href="#">Degory Priest</a>, <a href="#">George Soul</a>e and Richard
        Warren.[citation needed]
    </p>
    <p>In 1967, he graduated from <a href="#">North Syracuse Central High School</a>, where he excelled at gymnastics#
        and music and
        played the trumpet.<sup>><a href="#">[7]</a></sup> He attended the <a href="#">University of Massachusetts
            Amherst</a> on a
        gymnastics
        scholarship, studying
        philosophy; after two years, he left and did not graduate.<sup><a href="#">[7][12]</a></sup>

    </p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>Gere first worked professionally at the Seattle Repertory Theatre and the Provincetown Playhouse on Cape Cod in
        1969, where he starred in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. His first major acting role was in the original
        London stage version of Grease, in 1973.<sup><a href="#">[7]</a></sup> He was one of the first notable Hollywood
        actors to
        play a
        homosexual character, starring as a gay Holocaust victim in the 1979 Broadway production of Bent, for
        which he
        earned a Theatre World Award.

        Gere began appearing in<a href="#"> Hollywood</a> films in the mid-1970s. Originally cast in a starring role in
        The Lords of
        Flatbush (1974), he was replaced after fighting with his co-star Sylvester Stallone. He played a small but
        memorable part in Looking for <a href="#">Mr. Goodbar </a>(1977) and starred in director Terrence Malick's
        well-reviewed drama
        <a href="#">Days of Heaven</a> (1978).<a href="#">[7]</a># The crime drama <a href="#">American Gigolo</a>
        (1980)
        significantly boosted his
        profile and the
        <a href="">#romantic drama An Officer and a Gentleman (1982) (co-starring Debra Winger) cemented Gere's ascent
            to</a>#
        stardom,
        grossing almost $130 million<sup><a href="#">[13]</a></sup> and winning two Academy Awards out of six
        nominations;<sup><a href="#">[14]</a></sup> Gere
        himself
        received his first Golden Globe Award nomination.<sup><a href="#">[15]</a></sup>For the remainder of the 1980s,
        Gere
        appeared in films of
        varying critical and commercial reception.<sup><a href="#">[16][17]</a></sup> His career rebounded
        with the releases of
        Internal Affairs
        (1990) and<a href="#"> Pretty Woman</a> (1990), the latter of which earned him his second <a href="#">Golden
            Globe
            Award</a> nomination.<sup><a href="#">[18]</a></sup> The
        1990s saw Gere star in successful films including <a href="">Sommersby </a>(1993) (opposite Jodie Foster), <a
            href="#">Primal Fear</a> (1996)
        and <a href="#">Runaway Bride</a> (1999) (which reunited him with his Pretty Woman co-star Julia
        Roberts).<sup><a href="#">[16]</a></sup> He
        also took a
        leading role in the action thriller <a href="#">The Jackal</a> (1997), playing former IRA militant Declan
        Mulqueen; Gere
        affected an Irish accent for the role.<sup><a href="#">[19]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>Gere was named People magazine's <a href="#">"Sexiest Man Alive"</a> in 1999. Not long thereafter, all in the
        same year, he
        appeared in the hit films <a href="#">The Mothman Prophecies</a> (2002), <a href="#">Unfaithful</a> (2002) and
        the Academy Award-winning musical
        film adaptation <a href="#">Chicago </a>(2002),<a href="#">[7]</a> for which he won his first <a href="#">Golden
            Globe Award</a>. Gere's
        ballroom dancing drama
        <a href="#">Shall We Dance?</a> (2004) was also a solid performer that grossed $170 million worldwide.<sup><a
                href="#">[20]</a></sup> His
        next film, the
        book-to-screen adaptation <a href="">Bee Season</a> (2005), was a commercial failure.<sup><a
                href="#">[21]</a></sup> Gere went
        on to
        co-star with Jesse
        <a href="#">Eisenberg</a> and <a href="#">Terrence Howard</a> in <a href="#">The Hunting Party</a> (2007), a
        thriller in which he played a journalist in Bosnia.
        He next appeared with <a href="#">Christian Bale</a>, <a href="#">Heath Ledger</a> and <a href="#">Cate
            Blanchett</a> in <a href="#">T</a>odd Haynes' semi-biographical film
        about <a href=#">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href="#">I'm Not There</a> (2007); Gere was one of six actors to portray a
        variation of Dylan. He co-starred#
        with Diane Lane in the romantic drama <a href="#">Nights in Rodanthe</a> (2008). The film was widely panned by
        critics
        <sup> <a href="#">[22]</a></sup>

        (making #74 on The Times Worst Films of 2008 list),<sup><a href="#">[23]</a></sup> but grossed over $84 million
        worldwide.<sup><a href="#">[24]</a></sup> The film is
        his most recent to have been produced entirely by a<a href="#"> major film studio</a>.

    </p>
    <p>
        Gere has expressed a belief that his politics regarding China, an important financial resource for major
        Hollywood studios, have made him unwelcome within Hollywood.[25] He embraced his apparent exile from Hollywood
        and instead appeared in independent films that garnered some of the best reviews of his career.[17] He was
        notably singled out for portraying businessman Robert Miller in <a href="#">Arbitrage </a>(2012), earning his
        fourth Golden
        Globe Award nomination. Among many positive reviews,[26] Peter Travers of <a href="#">Rolling Stone</a> cited
        Gere's performance
        as "too good to ignore" and "an implosive tour de force".[27] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post further wrote
        that he "gives the best performance of his career".[28] Also in 2012, he received the <a href="#">Golden
            Starfish
            Award </a>for
        Lifetime Achievement from the <a href="#">Hamptons International Film Festival</a> and the <a href="#">Career
            Achievement Award </a>from the
        <a href="#">Hollywood Film Awards</a>.[29][30] He had earlier received an award from the<a href="#"> 34th Cairo
            International Film Festival</a>
        in December 2010.[31]

    </p>
    <p>
        Gere made a notable departure from his traditional screen persona with <a href="#">Joseph Cedar's</a> political
        drama Norman<sup></sup>
        <a href="">(2016). The film saw him portray Norman Oppenheimer, a small-time Jewish <a href="#">fixer</a>. Gere
            himself</a>
        described the
        character as an embodiment of the "sides of us we know are annoying and needy".<sup><a href="#">[32]</a></sup>
        His
        portrayal
        of Oppenheimer
        was called "consistently, completely fascinating" by <a href="#">RogerEbert.com</a><sup><a
                href="#">[33]</a></sup> and was
        singled out as a
        worthy<a href="#">
            Academy
            Award</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Gere is an accomplished musician, composing and performing the Pretty Woman piano theme and a guitar solo in
        Runaway Bride. He learned tap dance for his role as lawyer Billy Flynn in <a href="#">Chicago</a>.<sup><a
                href="#">[35]</a></sup> and
        karate for An Officer
        and a Gentleman.<sup><a href="#">[36]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        Multiple film critics and media outlets have cited Gere as one of the best actors never to have received an
        <a href="#">Academy Award</a> nomination.<sup><a href="#">[37][38]</a>
